It is not possible to create quality control plots (fits of _S_-1 as function of log(_N_)) because the number of samples is smaller then `r min_samples`.

```{r}
to_log("INFO", sprintf("The number of samples is smaller than %s...", min_samples))
to_log("INFO", "...therefore no quality control plots will be created.")
```
