The weights for each combination of `r title_text_plur` are given in the first `r number_of_indicators` columns of the table below. The remaining columns give the intercept b<sub>0</sub>, the slope b<sub>1</sub>, the adjusted r^2 and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson's adjusted r). The rows are sorted with respect to adjusted r^2.

    "w", 1:number_of_indicators, 
    " (", sub(pattern = "_STAR$", replacement = "*", x = names(d)[1:number_of_indicators]), ")")
